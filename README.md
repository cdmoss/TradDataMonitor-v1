# TradDataMonitor-v1
This is a student project resulting from a collaboration between the Medicine hat College and Trad Worm Industries. It serves to collect and store various types of data from sensors placed in a vermiculture environment and trigger alerts when the sensors report outside configurable boundaries. This initial version was made with [Avalonia](http://avaloniaui.net/), .NET Core, and the [Phidget](https://www.phidgets.com/) platform.
